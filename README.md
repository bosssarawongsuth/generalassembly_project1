## Title: SAT Student Performance & Benchmarks
### Scenario and Problem Statement

I work for an independent research organisation in West Virginia where SAT has recently become compulsory. [Source] I have been contacted by a school in that state to provide them with some advice and guidelines to the teaching staff to help

Identify students who are thriving and require greater challenges.
Identify students who require additional academic support.
Currently the school is only requiring Grade 12 students to do SAT exam with other Grades doing the school's own internal exams. The school is also exploring other options for these Grade 8-11 students in this regard as their internal grading system is not standardised.

Ultimately the school would like to ensure that the students across Grades 8-12 are on the right tracks to achieving the scores they need in order to study in their intended higher education institues and subjects. Additionally, the school would also like to know how the other states in the country are performing in the SAT and what the current trends are so they can better prepare the students.
